    "## Analyzing the Avocado Data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### This task uses the avocado dataset. The dataset contains historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple U.S. markets. One of the columns in this dataset, Unnamed: 0, contains sequential numbers that are irrelevant to analyzing this data. Three of the other columns contain sales for PLU (price look-up) codes 4046, 4225, and 4770. These columns will not be used in this task. If you review the data, you’ll see that some of the regions overlap. For example, one of the regions is the entire U.S., and all of the other regions are parts of the U.S. Because of that, you would need to review this data carefully before determining the best way to analyze it. For the purposes of this task though, the overlapping regions won’t be taken into consideration.\n",
