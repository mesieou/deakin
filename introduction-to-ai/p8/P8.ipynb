    "## Analyzing Twitter Data using NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "##### This task focuses on analyzing user replies to Covid-19 news published on the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) using some basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The task uses the `replies.csv` dataset, which contains the information about user replies to the Covid-19 news posted on Twitter. The columns capture the content related to the individual replies such as `text` (the actual text content of the reply), `id` (a unique ID for the reply itself), `conversation_id` (linking the reply to a specific conversation thread), `in_reply_to_user_id` (identifying the target user of the reply), and `possibly_sensitive` (indicating if the content may be sensitive). Additional informaiton include `author_id` (the unique ID of the reply's author), `author_followers` (the count of the author's followers),`author_tweets` (total tweets made by the author), and `author_location` (the geographical location of the author). Moreover, engagement metrics are tracked through columns like `retweets`, `replies`, `likes`, and `quote_count`. Time and location metadata are captured by `created_at` and `geo`, respectively, with `account` specifying the account name of the news publishers (e.g., BBC).\n",
